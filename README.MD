Python for Web Development at Clark State College.

## External Dependencies:
1. Flask - pip install flask

## To Run:
1. Install dependencies.
2. Run 'python init_db.py'.

## Currently, this won't display much, but it will be built gradually.
With any luck it will be mostly done by the end of the day!
